The tunnel you followed ends in a huge vault. In this vault,
there are book shelves that reach the ceiling. They are
filled with books and scrolls of all kinds. Actually it is
just one continuous book shelf. At a second look, it shows
that it is interrupted by torches which remind one of the
heads of dragons.

Congratulations!
You discovered the ruins of the Dragon Temple of Arkanar!
