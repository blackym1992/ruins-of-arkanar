»I am omnipresent and make life possible for you. At high speed
I can travel through valleys. Anyone who underestimates me will
then be torn to death by me. But still, everyone needs me,
because I can preserve his life. I even live in most beings
that exist. And despite my deadly nature, nobody wants to
miss me.

So the question is: Who am I?«
