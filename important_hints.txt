Please read this file first before you start extending this project.

In the following you will see some explanations for how to use the files.

DIRECTORY /files:
This directory contains all additional files that are read by the game itself. Its subdirectory "colors" contains files named after the corresponding language and only
contains the names of colors in that language (i.e. "blauw" in the file "nl-NL.txt" which is Dutch for "blue").

DIRECTORY /files/en-US:
All other folders contain text files with the story texts. Each folder is named after the language, using the official language codes used i.e. in HTML. In case of "en-US"
it contains the text files for the story in English (United States of America). If you want to add a language, please use this pattern for the directory (i.e. fr-FR for French).

FILE run.sh:
This file will run the app so that the player does not have to type in "dotnet run" everytime in the system's default CLI.
For Windows just rename it to "run.cmd" or "run.bat".
